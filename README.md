# libft
My own custom implementation of the libft library - by yademirk.

This version of libft is NOT the one I used to pass the libft project on 42 Schools. Instead, this one is a heavilty modified version that suits to my needs on each 42 project. It gets updated and new functions are added with each project I start. Therefore, it doesn't follow the usual libft structure and may contain additional functions (ft_printf, get_next_line, etc.). Do NOT use this to pass the libft project.

However, you may use it for learning purposes.
